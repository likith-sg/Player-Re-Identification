Specifically, each player detected in the video should retain a **consistent identity (ID)** throughout the 15-second footage, even if they **leave the frame and return later**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Instructions\n","\n","1. **Video Input**: Use the provided `15sec_input_720p.mp4` sports footage file as input.\n","2. **Object Detection**: Use the provided YOLOv11 model (fine-tuned for player and ball detection) to detect players in each frame.\n","3. **Initial ID Assignment**: Assign unique IDs to players based on the first few seconds of the video.\n","4. **Re-Identification**: When a player leaves and re-enters the frame (e.g., during a goal event), ensure they are **assigned the same ID** as before.\n","5. **Real-Time Simulation**: Should simulate real-time re-identification and player tracking..\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Given Model Details\n","\n","- **Model Link**: [Provided YOLOv11 Object Detection
